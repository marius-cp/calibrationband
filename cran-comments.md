## Details on the note

> checking compiled code ... NOTE
  Note: information on .o files for i386 is not available

The note concerns ".o" and ".dll" documents in the "src" folder. On MacOS operating system this note did not appear. Therefore, it seems to be a local problem that is not relevant for the actual creation of the package.
