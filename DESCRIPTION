Description: Package to assess the calibration of probabilistic classifiers using confidence bands for monotonic functions. Besides testing the classical goodness-of-fit null hypothesis of perfect calibration, the confidence bands calculated within that package facilitate inverted goodness-of-fit tests whose rejection allows for a sought-after conclusion of a sufficiently well-calibrated model. The package creates flexible graphical tools to perform these tests.  For construction details see also Dimitriadis, DÃ¼mbgen, Henzi, Puke, Ziegel (2022) <arXiv:2203.04065>.
